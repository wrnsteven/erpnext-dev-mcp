> Note: Alternatively, you could open the record for the Asset in question and click on the **Repair Asset** button under **Manage**, and then follow steps 3-8.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Capitalize Repair Cost

If checked, the Repair Cost will be added to the Asset's value. This could also allow you to increase the Asset's life.

### 3.2 Increase In Asset Life(Months)

The number of months by which the Asset's life might be extended by the repair can be added here. This will modify the Depreciation Schedule of the Asset. This field will only be visible if Capitalize Repair Cost is checked.

### 3.3 Consumed Stock Items
