# Downloading Backups

In ERPNext, you can manually download a database backup.

To get the latest database backup, go to:

> Home > Download Backups

Backup available for the download is updated every eight hours. Click on the link to download the backup at a given time.

If you want to set the number of Backups available for download at a time, then click on 'Set Number of Backups', which will navigate you to 'System Settings', where you can set the number.
