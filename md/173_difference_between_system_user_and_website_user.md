# Difference Between System User and Website User

**Question:** I have added my Employee as a User and have assigned them Roles as well. Still, they are not able to view Dashboard on the login.

**Answer:**

There are two type of Users in ERPNext.

- **System Users**: They are typically internal users such as employees, managers, and administrators who need extensive access to the ERPNext system to perform various business operations. They have a higher level of access and more detailed permissions, allowing them to interact with multiple modules, generate reports, and customize workflows.
- **Website Users**: They are typically external users like customers or suppliers who interact with the ERPNext system through a web portal. Their access is limited to functionalities relevant to their needs, such as placing orders, viewing order status, or managing their account information. Their interface is simpler compared to the comprehensive backend interface used by system users.

Here is the tabular comparison between System User and Website User in ERPNext
