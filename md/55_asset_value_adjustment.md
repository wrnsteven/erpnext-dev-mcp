# Asset Value Adjustment

**If the value of an Asset changed suddenly due to any damages, it can be recorded using Asset Value Adjustment.**

In case of fixed asset management, sometimes the value of an asset needs some adjustment. For example, if a laptop gets damaged for some reason, and its value will be dropped instantly. And in that case, we have to readjust the value of the asset.
