# Easy steps to setup Workflow

When a company has multiple levels of approval for a document, a Workflow can be set.
In ERPNext, you can go to Workflow list --> Create New --> Name the workflow and define :1. States
2. Transition rules.

1. States :

When a document is passed on for different levels of approval, there are states defined at each level for the role of the user.

1. Transition Rules :

For instance: A **Sales user** is only allowed to create a **Quotation** and it can be saved in the **Draft** state. Further, it can be sent to the **Sales Manager** for approval and the User with this role can have the permission to either **Approve** or **Reject** the Quotation after which it can either be sent to the **Draft** State if **Rejected** or final **Approved** State.

Error Messages: **A document cannot be Cancelled before it is Submitted.**
[This is a typical error faced by users who define the state of the Document cancelled before Submitting it. Doc Status 1 defines that the Document will be Submitted at that State, thus the State with Doc status 2 should only be defined in the Transition after the State with Doc status 1. ]
