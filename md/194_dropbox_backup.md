# Setting Up Dropbox Backups

We always recommend customers to maintain backup of their data in ERPNext. The database backup is downloaded in the form of an SQL file. If needed, this SQL file of backup can be restored in the another ERPNext account as well.

You can automate database backup download of your ERPNext account into your Dropbox account.

> Note: If you are Frappe Cloud user, onsite and offsite backups are automatically created for you: <https://frappecloud.com/docs/sites/backups>

To setup Dropbox Backup, > Home > Integrations > Dropbox Settings

### Step 7: Input Keys from your Dropbox App window

From your Dropbox App page, enter the app key and (unhidden) app secret into the ERPNext Dropbox settings page.

Alternatively, you can enter it manually in `sites/{sitename}/site_config.json` as follows,

```
       {
	 "db_name": "demo",
	 "db_password": "DZ1Idd55xJ9qvkHvUH",
	 "dropbox_access_key": "ACCESSKEY",
	 "dropbox_secret_key": "SECRECTKEY"
}

```

### Step 8: Click Save before continuing

### Step 9: After saving, click "Allow Dropbox Access"

The Dropbox login page will open in the new tab. This might require you to allow pop-up for your ERPNext account.

### Step 11: Allow Dropbox Access

On successful login, you will find a confirmation message as following. Click on "Allow" to let your ERPNext account have access to your Dropbox account.

### Step 12: Confirm Backups Work

From the ERPNext Dropbox page, click `Take Backup Now` and then go to you Dropbox files view. You should see a new folder in Dropbox named `Apps` and inside of it your {New App} folder. Inside of it should be backup folders for both files and database. So for an app named `erpnext`, following are the folder locations:

```
Database files: /Apps/erpnext/database
Public files: /Apps/erpnext/files
Private files: /Apps/erpnext/private/files


```
