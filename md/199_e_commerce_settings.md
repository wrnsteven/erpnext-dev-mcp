# E Commerce Settings

The legacy **Shopping Cart Settings** and **Products Settings** are combined into a single **E-Commerce Settings** page.

The e-commerce settings in ERPNext can be leveraged by users to manage and streamline the online sales processes. These settings can enable users to efficiently manage product listing, customer management and integration with other ERPNext modules seamlessly.

> **E Commerce Settings / Webshop Settings** in the awesomebar (search bar)

You can also add filters to your listing. There are two types of filters:

1. **Field Filters**: Enable the **Field Filters** checkbox and add the fields based on which you want to have filters. These fields will also be used as categories for the **Shop by Category** page.
2. **Attribute Filters**: Enable the **Attribute Filters** checkbox and add the attributes based on which you want to have filters.

### Display Settings

1. **Hide Variants**: Only show Website Item Templates on the Product Listing.
2. **Enable Variant Selection**: Show a configure button if the Item has variants. It can be used to narrow down the specific item based on Attributes.
3. **Show Price**: Show Item Price on the product page.
4. **Show Stock Availability**: Show whether the Item is in stock.
5. **Show Stock Quantity**: Show available stock on the product page.
6. **Allow items not in stock to be added to cart**: Allow items not in stock to be added to Cart.
7. **Show Apply Coupon Code**: Additional provision to apply coupon code at checkout.

A [Quotation](/erpnext/quotation) is generated in the system. If enabled, a [Sales Order](/erpnext/sales-order) is generated on clicking on the **Place Order** button in the Cart.
2. **Payment Gateway Account**: If checkout is enabled, you must have [PayPal Integration](/erpnext/paypal-integration) or [Razorpay Integration](/erpnext/razorpay-integration).
3. **Payment Success Url**: After payment completion redirect users to the selected option.
4. **Show Price in Quotation**: If checkout is disabled, you can choose whether or not to show prices against Website Items in the Quotation.
5. **Save Quotations as Draft**: If checkout is disabled, on clicking on the **Request for Quotation** button, you can choose whether the auto-generated Quotation must be auto-submitted or kept in the Draft state.

### Add-ons

1. **Enable Wishlist**: Add the provision to add items to a Wishlist
2. **Enable Reviews and Ratings**: Add the privision for **customers** to leave reviews and ratings against Website Items.
3. **Enable Recommendations**: Add the provision to show manually selected **recommended items** against a Website Item.

### Shop By Category

The **Shop By Category** page is an out-of-the-box page that lists categories linked to Website Items. These categories can be configured in the **Filters and Categories** section's **Field Filters** table.

You can also select a slideshow as the banner of the page.

### Guest Display Settings

1. **Hide Price for Guest**: You can show or hide prices against Website Items for guest users (users who are not logged in).
2. **Redirect on Action**: If a guest user tries to add a Website Item to Cart or to the Wishlist, you can select a URL to redirect them to. By default, guest users are redirected to the `/login` page. You can instead redirect them to a custom Web Form of choice by adding a URL here e.g. `/contact-us`
