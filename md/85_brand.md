# Brand

**A Brand identifies items with a specific name.**

Usually, a Brand is the manufacturer or packer of a specific product. For example, Apple is a brand that manufactures laptops. A Brand is not necessarily the [Manufacturer](/erpnext/manufacturer) of an Item, it's only the name under which a product is sold. For example, if you manufacture plastic cups, you may license them to a big brand so that they sell them under their Brand.

In ERPNext, Brands can be assigned to Items for identifying and assigning certain defaults.

To access the Brand list, go to:

> Home > Selling > Sales > Brand

## 1. How to Create a Brand
