# Custom Translations in Print Formats

**With Custom Translations, user can print the customer's and supplier's document in their local language.**

For example, if you have customers from Germany and France who want quotations in German and French, it's possible using Custom Translations.

## 1. Set the Language

In the Customer master, select the default Language. Say, the default language for the Customer is **Spanish**.

The translation is applied when the user selects the language as Spanish on supplier Quotation's print preview. Note that no translation is applied for the second item's description since it wasn't created in the Translation list.
